# 🧠 Coding Problem Solving Template
    
## 1. 🔍 Problem Understanding

 - Problem Statement: Write a brief summary in your own words.
 - Input Format: What are the inputs? Types, constraints, edge cases. 
 - Output Format: What should the function return?

## 2. 🧪 Examples & Edge Cases

- Example Inputs & Outputs: List 2–3 examples with expected results.
- Edge Cases: Empty input, single element, large input, etc.

## 3. 🧭 Strategy & Approach

- High-Level Idea: Describe the main logic or algorithm.
- Subtasks: Break the problem into smaller steps if needed.
- Data Structures Used: Lists, sets, dictionaries, stacks, etc.

## 4.  🧮 Pseudocode

```text
- Write a rough outline of your logic here.
- Use indentation and comments to clarify steps.
```
## 5.  🧑‍💻 Implementation

- Code: Write the actual code in your preferred language.
- Line-by-Line Explanation: Explain each part if you're teaching or reviewing.

## 6. 🧪 Testing

- Manual Tests: Run your examples and edge cases.
- Automated Tests (if applicable): Use assertions or unit tests.

## 7. ⚙️ Optimization & Complexity

- Time Complexity: e.g., O(n), O(n log n), etc.
- Space Complexity: e.g., O(1), O(n), etc.
- Can it be improved? Discuss trade-offs or alternate approaches.

# 8. 🧠 Reflection

- What did you learn? New techniques, patterns, or insights.
- How would you explain this to a student? Simplify and clarify.
